# Spotifying Youtube

A simple web application that allow user to create spotify playlist using their Youtube playlist. 

## Movivation 
My goal for this web application is to implement a full stack application to gain experience in the following areas:
1. Implementing frontend using AngularJS
2. Implementing backend using Flask 
3. Working with external API 
4. Developing a responsive user interface compatible with user authentication and authorization. 
5. Deploying application to Heroku 

## Tech Stack 
1. Flask [https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/#]. Flask is a web microframework for building web applications with Python. 
2. AngularJS [https://angularjs.org/] AngularJS is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework.
3. Youtube Data API v3 [https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3]. Add YouTube features to your application, including the ability to upload videos, create and manage playlists, and more.
4. Spotify Web API [https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/] Based on simple REST principles, the Spotify Web API endpoints return JSON metadata about music artists, albums, and tracks, directly from the Spotify Data Catalogue.
5. Requests Library v 2.22.0 [https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/] Requests is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, built for human beings.
6. Youtube_dl v 2020.01.24 [https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/] - download videos from youtube.com or other video platforms
